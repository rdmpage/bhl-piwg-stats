- How many cited works pre-date 1923 but don't have a DOI?
\nReferences with links to BHL but no DOI are likely to be cases where BHL could add value by adding DOIs. References that pre-date 1923 have a good chance of being in BHL, and hence ideally would have DOIs.\nNote that the reason for using _ZooKeys_ is that the content of each article can be downloadsed as XML and hence we can extract the list of literature cited.";
